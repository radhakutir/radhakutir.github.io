<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><i><u>About Hatha Yoga</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">The
word Yoga has various meanings within different traditions. According to Lord
Krishna, Yoga is an &quot;evenness of mind&quot; . Krishna also defined Yoga as
a life style, which embodies the philosophy of &quot;skill in action&quot;
(Karma Yoga). Maharishi Patanjali, the founder of modern Yoga principles, has
said that Yoga is a discipline of the mind through the 'cessation of thought'
and a discipline of the body.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Hatha
Yoga brings all these components together in harmony by integrating the physical
body, the breathing process (i.e. Prana or the vital energy) and the
psychological aspects of one's being. By practicing Hatha Yoga, one brings a
balance to the body, mind and spirit.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><i><u>Weekly
Yoga Classes&nbsp;</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">At the
Neo Yoga and Meditation Center in Bhagsunag, Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh,
India, Hatha Yoga Asanas (postures) are taught. These are suitable for beginner
to advanced students. The various Asanas help energize the body, release tension
and stress, and increase overall feeling of well-being.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Breathing
techniques (Pranayama) are also taught. Though breathing is a natural process,
many of us do not breathe properly. When one learns to breathe fully and
systematically, Prana (the life force) is activated. With each full breath one
takes, especially when integrated with Yoga Asanas, one becomes more expansive,
joyful and opens oneself more fully to life.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">In all
Yoga classes individual's needs and concerns are taken into consideration. Yoga
Asanas are taught with utmost personal care.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><i><u>Health
and Safety Concerns</u></i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Any
health concerns or problems are discussed with the students at the beginning of
the program and advice given accordingly.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><u><i>Yoga
and meditation Retreats</i></u></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">In any
spiritual following, an intense focus and concentration is needed at times. A
spiritual retreat can provide such an opportunity to deepen the student's
development and practice.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">During
the retreat, participants learn and practice Hatha Yoga, meditation, relaxation,
Pranayama, Kriyas, Vedanta philosophy and devotional singing (Bhajans).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">For

<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><i>What
is Reiki?</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Reiki
is a natural and an ancient method of healing oneself and others through deep
relaxation techniques. Reiki is a Japanese word that means universal life
energy. This life force is present in every human being and works in the
physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual realms.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Results
from the use of Reiki vary with each individual but many people report lower
stress levels, improved immune systems, higher energy levels, improved mental
states etc.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b><i>How
does one learn the art of Reiki?</i></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Becoming
a Reiki practitioner involves training at three levels.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b>Level
one:</b> One receives attunements and learns how to apply Reiki techniques on
oneself and others.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b>Level
two: </b>One receives attunements and learns how to transmit Reiki beyond time
and space using Reiki symbols and Mantras.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4"><b>Master
Level three: </b>One learns how to initiate, give attunements and teach Reiki
techniques.</font></p>

the Instructor</u></i></b></font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Br.
AKHILESH has been teaching Yoga and Meditation since 1994. Many students from
all over the world have attended his classes in Dharamshala and Rishikesh,
India. He has received a wide range of academic and spiritual training.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Akhilesh
was raised in an educated family in a small business community in Lucknow, U.P.,
India. From his childhood he was driven by an urge to inquire about the
mysteries of creation, life, death and human sufferings etc. At the age of 18 he had
a spiritual vision and had realized that his life should be dedicated for the
service of people in need.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Akhilesh
decided to study sociology and then serve in a public office. With this view in
mind, after graduating from Lucknow University, Akhilesh contested an election
for a local public office.&nbsp; After serving as a social worker for a period
of time, his childhood vision of doing spiritually beneficial work resurfaced.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">It was
then that he left his career as a politician and began leading a life of a
renunciate. He joined the movement of Swami Chinmayananda and lived in an Ashram
in Tapovan for two years. He later became a student of Swami Dayananda
Saraswati, a scholar and a teacher of Vedanta, and studied this ancient Hindu
Philosophy and Sanskrit. After completing a three and a half year Vedanta
course, he continued to practice his spiritual pursuits integrating Yoga and
Meditation into his daily Sadhana.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">Akhilesh
then began teaching Yoga, Meditation and Vedanta philosophy in accordance with
the tradition. He has a deep understanding of these principles and thus
continues to share this Eastern wisdom with his students. Akhilesh's gentle and
compassionate nature and his unique ability to communicate this great wisdom to
others, opens the way for all students to learn.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font color="#00FFFF" size="4">The
MUKTI COMMUNE, which Akhilesh has founded is working towards establishing
ongoing Yoga and Meditation courses and retreats for personal and spiritual
growth. It is in the process of establishing a permanent retreat center in or
near Rishikesh, India. If you have any questions or comments in this regard, you
may contact us.</font></p>
