People are funny; they want the front of the bus, the middle<br>
of the road, and the back of the church.<br>
<br>
The phrase that is guaranteed to wake up an audience: &quot;And<br>
in conclusion.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know why some people change churches; what<br>
difference does it make which one you stay home from?<br>
<br>
The difference between an expert and a novice is that the <br>
novice hesitates before doing anything stupid.<br>
<br>
Only fools can be certain; it takes wisdom to be confused.<br>

I took an IQ test and the results were negative.<br>

Two rural church deacons who were having a sociable beer in <br>
the local tavern when they saw their minister drive by and <br>
take a good long look at their pickup trucks parked outside.<br>
<br>
One deacon ducked down and said, &quot;I hope the reverend didn't<br>
see us or recognize my pickup.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other replied indifferently, &quot;What difference does it <br>
make? God knows we're in here... and he's the only one who <br>
counts.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first deacon answered, &quot;Yeah, but God won't tell my wife.&quot;<br>

<h3>A Few One-liners ...</h3>
<p><i>&quot;Meditation - You have the right to remain silent.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Don't just do something, sit there.&quot;</i></p>
<p><em>&quot;Life is hard. It's breathe, breathe, breathe, all the time.&quot;</em></p>

<p>A rabbi is overcome with spiritual ecstasy and runs up to the altar, throwing
himself on his knees, crying, <i>&quot;I'm nobody Lord! I'm nobody!
Nobody!&quot;</i><br>
The cantor witnesses his state of humility and unity with the One and is so
deeply moved, he too runs to altar yelling, <i>&quot;Lord, I'm nobody! I'm
nobody, Lord!&quot;</i><br>
The janitor mopping the floor is dumbstruck, and also deeply moved. Filled with
piety and a fervent spirit, he drops his mop and also dashes to the altar,
proclaiming, <i>&quot;I'm nobody! Oh Lord, hear me, I'm nobody! Nobody!&quot;</i><br>
He prostrates himself beside the rabbi and cantor, repeating this mantrik cry,
as the rabbi takes notice, turns to the cantor, and with a gesture, says, <i>&quot;So,
look who's nobody.&quot;</i></p>

<p>There was a religious lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her very nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read as it helped relax her on the long
fights.<br>
One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her Bible, he
gave a little chuckle and smirk and went back to what he was doing.<br>
After awhile, he turned to her and asked, &quot;You don't really believe all
that stuff in there do you?&quot;<br>
The lady replied, &quot;Of course I do. It is the Bible.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?&quot;<br>
She replied, &quot;Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible.&quot;<br>
He asked, &quot;Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?&quot;<br>
The lady said, &quot;Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him.&quot;<br>
&quot;What if he isn't in heaven?&quot; the man asked sarcastically.<br>
&quot;Then you can ask him,&quot; replied the lady.</p>

<p>At the entrance to a temple there was a beggar always asking for alms
stretching one hand. One day he stretched both of his hands. A passerby asked
him: all these days, you were stretching one hand, why are you stretching two
hands today?<br>
To which the beggar replied: Prabhu, the business was so good that I opened a
branch!<br>

When the Yogi got the pizza, he gave the proprietor a $20 bill. The proprietor
pocketed the bill. The Yogi said <em>&quot;Don't I get change?&quot;</em> The
proprietor said, <em>&quot;Change must come from within.&quot;</em>

This guy was climbing a tree when suddenly he slipped, then grabbed at a branch
and was hanging there. After an hour or so had passed he felt himself getting
exhausted and looked up to the heavens and cried out: &quot;God, help me,
please, help me.&quot;<br>
All of a sudden the clouds parted and a voice boomed out from on high. <strong><em>&quot;Let
Go!&quot;</em></strong> said the voice.<br>
The guy paused and looked up at heaven once more, then said: <em>&quot;Is there
anyone else up there?&quot;</em>

<p>A priest and bus driver lived together and one day they also together died.<br>
They go to St. Peter standing before heaven gate. He allows the bus driver to go
to one of the highest heavens but the priest has to wait.<br>
He waits for long time and finally goes to St. Peter and asks: <em>&quot;Why
could that bus driver go to the highest heaven and I, who all my life spoke
about God, have to wait for such a long time?&quot;</em><br>
St. Peter said: <em>&quot;When you were speaking to the people at your church
everybody was sleeping, but when that bus driver was driving everybody
prayed!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Another story coming from Switzerland. This time the story is in French and
it is actually impossible to translate it into English. It plays with the words
and has a cultural reference (you have to be born there, sorry :-).
<p>Dans un monast√®re, 2 &quot;bonzes&quot; sont les meilleurs amis du monde.
Chaque matin, ils se l√®vent joyeusement et vont ensemble sonner le gong qui
r√©veillera tout le monast√®re.<br>
Un beau matin, a leur grande surprise, le gong sonne faux! Immediatement la
discorde s'installe entre les deux amis ... On fait donc venir l'accordeur de
gong qui apr√®s quelques reglages, redonne au gong sa sonorit√©. Et c'est ainsi
que les 2 bonzes retrouvent l'harmonie et la paix.<br>
Moralit√©: <b>&quot;Les bons gongs font les bonzes amis&quot;</b></p>

<p><i>This story was sent to her by a Yogi from Switzerland who founded the <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/locations/centers/geneva/geneva.htm">Geneva
Sivananda Yoga Center.</a></i>
<p>The Swiss, as we all know, tend to be placid people. Some go as far as
claiming that we are occasionally somewhat slow.<br>
Three Swiss monks of the benediction order were meditating high in the Alps.
Suddenly, a beautiful milk cow walked by.<br>
The first monk said : <i>&quot;HHHMMM, this is Fritz's cow, I tell you&quot;.</i><br>
Half an hour later, the second monk said : <i>&quot; HHHMMM, really that was
Kurt's cow. I'm quite sure&quot;.</i><br>
An other half hour later, the third Swiss monk stood up and said <i>&quot;I'm
going away, I can't stand you guys having an argument around me when I'm trying
to meditate&quot;....</i></p>

<p>Four monks were meditating in a monastery. All of a sudden the prayer flag on
the roof started flapping. The younger monk came out of his meditation and said:
<cite>&quot;Flag is flapping&quot;</cite><br>
A more experienced monk said: <cite><strong>&quot;Wind</strong> is
flapping&quot;</cite><br>
A third monk who had been there for more than 20 years said: <cite><strong>&quot;Mind</strong>
is flapping.&quot;</cite><br>
The fourth monk who was the eldest said, visibly annoyed: <cite><strong>&quot;Mouths</strong>
are flapping!&quot;</cite></p>

<p>An aspiring Yogi wanted to find a <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/guru.htm">Guru</a>.
He went to an Ashram and his preceptor told him: <cite>You can stay here but we
have one important rule - all students observe Mauna or vow of silence. You will
be allowed to speak in 12 years</cite>. After practicing for 12 long years <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/exercise.htm">Yoga
Asanas</a>, <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/breathin.htm">Pranayama</a>, <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/meditati.htm">Meditation</a>,
a lot of Karma Yoga, etc., the day came when the student could say his one thing
or ask his one question.<br>
He said: <cite>&quot;The bed is too hard.&quot;</cite><br>
He kept going for another 12 years of hard Sadhana and austere discipline and
got the opportunity to speak again. He said: <cite>&quot;The food is not
good.&quot;</cite><br>
Twelve more years of hard work and he got to speak again. Here are his words
after 36 years of practice: <cite>&quot;I quit.&quot;</cite><br>
His Guru quickly answered: <cite>&quot;Good, all you have been doing anyway is
complaining.&quot;</cite></p>

<p>If God is not the answer, what was the question?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the majority of us the most horrible fear is the fear of speaking in
front of a public and the second most frightening fear is the fear of death.<br>
Does that mean that if we had to do a speech at a funeral we would prefer to be
dead ?</p>
