People are funny; they want the front of the bus, the middle<br>
of the road, and the back of the church.<br>
<br>
The phrase that is guaranteed to wake up an audience: &quot;And<br>
in conclusion.&quot;<br>
<br>
I don't know why some people change churches; what<br>
difference does it make which one you stay home from?<br>
<br>
The difference between an expert and a novice is that the <br>
novice hesitates before doing anything stupid.<br>
<br>
Only fools can be certain; it takes wisdom to be confused.<br>

I took an IQ test and the results were negative.<br>

Women don't make fools of men, most of them are the <br>

Two rural church deacons who were having a sociable beer in <br>
the local tavern when they saw their minister drive by and <br>
take a good long look at their pickup trucks parked outside.<br>
<br>
One deacon ducked down and said, &quot;I hope the reverend didn't<br>
see us or recognize my pickup.&quot;<br>
<br>
The other replied indifferently, &quot;What difference does it <br>
make? God knows we're in here... and he's the only one who <br>
counts.&quot;<br>
<br>
The first deacon answered, &quot;Yeah, but God won't tell my wife.&quot;<br>

<h3>A Few One-liners ...</h3>
<p><i>&quot;Meditation - You have the right to remain silent.&quot;</i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Don't just do something, sit there.&quot;</i></p>
<p><em>&quot;Life is hard. It's breathe, breathe, breathe, all the time.&quot;</em></p>

<p>A rabbi is overcome with spiritual ecstasy and runs up to the altar, throwing
himself on his knees, crying, <i>&quot;I'm nobody Lord! I'm nobody!
Nobody!&quot;</i><br>
The cantor witnesses his state of humility and unity with the One and is so
deeply moved, he too runs to altar yelling, <i>&quot;Lord, I'm nobody! I'm
nobody, Lord!&quot;</i><br>
The janitor mopping the floor is dumbstruck, and also deeply moved. Filled with
piety and a fervent spirit, he drops his mop and also dashes to the altar,
proclaiming, <i>&quot;I'm nobody! Oh Lord, hear me, I'm nobody! Nobody!&quot;</i><br>
He prostrates himself beside the rabbi and cantor, repeating this mantrik cry,
as the rabbi takes notice, turns to the cantor, and with a gesture, says, <i>&quot;So,
look who's nobody.&quot;</i></p>

<p>There was a religious lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her very nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read as it helped relax her on the long
fights.<br>
One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her Bible, he
gave a little chuckle and smirk and went back to what he was doing.<br>
After awhile, he turned to her and asked, &quot;You don't really believe all
that stuff in there do you?&quot;<br>
The lady replied, &quot;Of course I do. It is the Bible.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?&quot;<br>
She replied, &quot;Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible.&quot;<br>
He asked, &quot;Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?&quot;<br>
The lady said, &quot;Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him.&quot;<br>
&quot;What if he isn't in heaven?&quot; the man asked sarcastically.<br>
&quot;Then you can ask him,&quot; replied the lady.</p>

<p>At the entrance to a temple there was a beggar always asking for alms
stretching one hand. One day he stretched both of his hands. A passerby asked
him: all these days, you were stretching one hand, why are you stretching two
hands today?<br>
To which the beggar replied: Prabhu, the business was so good that I opened a
branch!<br>

<cite>&quot;Make me one with everything.&quot;</cite>

When the Yogi got the pizza, he gave the proprietor a $20 bill. The proprietor
pocketed the bill. The Yogi said <em>&quot;Don't I get change?&quot;</em> The
proprietor said, <em>&quot;Change must come from within.&quot;</em>

This guy was climbing a tree when suddenly he slipped, then grabbed at a branch
and was hanging there. After an hour or so had passed he felt himself getting
exhausted and looked up to the heavens and cried out: &quot;God, help me,
please, help me.&quot;<br>
All of a sudden the clouds parted and a voice boomed out from on high. <strong><em>&quot;Let
Go!&quot;</em></strong> said the voice.<br>
The guy paused and looked up at heaven once more, then said: <em>&quot;Is there
anyone else up there?&quot;</em>

<p>A priest and bus driver lived together and one day they also together died.<br>
They go to St. Peter standing before heaven gate. He allows the bus driver to go
to one of the highest heavens but the priest has to wait.<br>
He waits for long time and finally goes to St. Peter and asks: <em>&quot;Why
could that bus driver go to the highest heaven and I, who all my life spoke
about God, have to wait for such a long time?&quot;</em><br>
St. Peter said: <em>&quot;When you were speaking to the people at your church
everybody was sleeping, but when that bus driver was driving everybody
prayed!&quot;</em></p>

<p>Another story coming from Switzerland. This time the story is in French and
it is actually impossible to translate it into English. It plays with the words
and has a cultural reference (you have to be born there, sorry :-).
<p>Dans un monastère, 2 &quot;bonzes&quot; sont les meilleurs amis du monde.
Chaque matin, ils se lèvent joyeusement et vont ensemble sonner le gong qui
réveillera tout le monastère.<br>
Un beau matin, a leur grande surprise, le gong sonne faux! Immediatement la
discorde s'installe entre les deux amis ... On fait donc venir l'accordeur de
gong qui après quelques reglages, redonne au gong sa sonorité. Et c'est ainsi
que les 2 bonzes retrouvent l'harmonie et la paix.<br>
Moralité: <b>&quot;Les bons gongs font les bonzes amis&quot;</b></p>

<p><i>This story was sent to her by a Yogi from Switzerland who founded the <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/locations/centers/geneva/geneva.htm">Geneva
Sivananda Yoga Center.</a></i>
<p>The Swiss, as we all know, tend to be placid people. Some go as far as
claiming that we are occasionally somewhat slow.<br>
Three Swiss monks of the benediction order were meditating high in the Alps.
Suddenly, a beautiful milk cow walked by.<br>
The first monk said : <i>&quot;HHHMMM, this is Fritz's cow, I tell you&quot;.</i><br>
Half an hour later, the second monk said : <i>&quot; HHHMMM, really that was
Kurt's cow. I'm quite sure&quot;.</i><br>
An other half hour later, the third Swiss monk stood up and said <i>&quot;I'm
going away, I can't stand you guys having an argument around me when I'm trying
to meditate&quot;....</i></p>

<p>Four monks were meditating in a monastery. All of a sudden the prayer flag on
the roof started flapping. The younger monk came out of his meditation and said:
<cite>&quot;Flag is flapping&quot;</cite><br>
A more experienced monk said: <cite><strong>&quot;Wind</strong> is
flapping&quot;</cite><br>
A third monk who had been there for more than 20 years said: <cite><strong>&quot;Mind</strong>
is flapping.&quot;</cite><br>
The fourth monk who was the eldest said, visibly annoyed: <cite><strong>&quot;Mouths</strong>
are flapping!&quot;</cite></p>

<p>An aspiring Yogi wanted to find a <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/guru.htm">Guru</a>.
He went to an Ashram and his preceptor told him: <cite>You can stay here but we
have one important rule - all students observe Mauna or vow of silence. You will
be allowed to speak in 12 years</cite>. After practicing for 12 long years <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/exercise.htm">Yoga
Asanas</a>, <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/breathin.htm">Pranayama</a>, <a href="http://www.sivananda.org/meditati.htm">Meditation</a>,
a lot of Karma Yoga, etc., the day came when the student could say his one thing
or ask his one question.<br>
He said: <cite>&quot;The bed is too hard.&quot;</cite><br>
He kept going for another 12 years of hard Sadhana and austere discipline and
got the opportunity to speak again. He said: <cite>&quot;The food is not
good.&quot;</cite><br>
Twelve more years of hard work and he got to speak again. Here are his words
after 36 years of practice: <cite>&quot;I quit.&quot;</cite><br>
His Guru quickly answered: <cite>&quot;Good, all you have been doing anyway is
complaining.&quot;</cite></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the majority of us the most horrible fear is the fear of speaking in
front of a public and the second most frightening fear is the fear of death.<br>
Does that mean that if we had to do a speech at a funeral we would prefer to be
dead ?</p>
